Code for AISTATS 2017 paper on "Conjugate-Computation Variational Inference".

To reproduce Fig. 1(a) in the paper, run `log_reg_expt.m'

For a comparison on GP binary classification, run `gp_demo.m' in the 'gp/' folder.

We will add code for other results (e.g. Gamma models) in the next few days! But if you need the code urgently, please email emtiyaz@gmail.com
